# HEARTBEAT.md - Task Progress Protocol

*This file defines when and how I check task progress.*

## 💓 Heartbeats - Be Proactive!

When you receive a heartbeat poll (message matches the configured heartbeat prompt), don't just reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` every time. Use heartbeats productively!

### Active Task Monitoring (Heartbeat Protocol)

During **active tasks** (when you have delegated work in progress):
- Check `subagents list` every 4 minutes when polled by a heartbeat.
- Report progress summary back to the user.
- Update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with current subagent statuses.
- Immediately flag any blocked dependencies.

### Heartbeat vs Cron: When to Use Each

**Use heartbeat when:**
- You have active, delegated work in progress that requires monitoring.
- Multiple checks can batch together
- You need conversational context from recent messages
- Timing can drift slightly (every ~30 min is fine, not exact)
- You want to reduce API calls by combining periodic checks

**Use cron when:**
- Exact timing matters ("9:00 AM sharp every Monday")
- Task needs isolation from main session history

**Track your checks** in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`.

**When to reach out:**
- Important email arrived
- Calendar event coming up (<2h)
- You hit a blocker executing a test
- It's been >8h since you said anything

**When to stay quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK):**
- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- Human is clearly busy
- Nothing new since last check
- You just checked <30 minutes ago

### 🔄 Memory Maintenance (During Heartbeats)

Periodically (every few days), use a heartbeat to:
1. Read through recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files
2. Identify significant events, lessons, or insights worth keeping long-term
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with distilled learnings
4. Remove outdated info from MEMORY.md that's no longer relevant
