# Changelog

All notable repository-level changes are tracked in this file.

This repository uses a four-part version in [`VERSION`](/Users/xuyin/Documents/Repository/openclaw-qa-workspace/VERSION): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO`.

## [0.1.8.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`structured-slide-spec.js`** — new `ppt-agent` module that converts a canonical slide brief to a normalized structured slide spec with layout mapping, body content, and design token resolution. Supports 10 composition families (PROCESS_FLOW, COMPARISON_MATRIX, TABLE_SUMMARY, EVIDENCE_PANEL, TITLE_HERO, SECTION_DIVIDER, CHECKLIST_CARDS, QA_TWO_COLUMN, TEXT_STATEMENT, CLOSING_STATEMENT) with fallback to `two_column` for unrecognized families.
- **`structured_rebuild` action type in `edit-handoff.js`** — `applyAction()` now dispatches `structured_rebuild` actions to `applyStructuredRebuildAction()`, which loads the canonical slide brief and source-theme-snapshot.json, builds a structured slide spec, and returns a planned job with `artifact_path` and `structured_spec` for downstream renderer wiring.
- **`merge-back.js` explicit step-function exports** — refactored from a single opaque orchestrator to six individually-exported, independently-testable functions: `extractSlidePackage`, `allocateNonConflictingIds`, `updatePresentationXml`, `updateContentTypes`, `copyMediaDependencies`, `validateNeighboringSlides`, plus the `mergeRebuiltSlide` orchestrator.
- **48 new tests** across 3 files: `merge-back.test.js` (22 unit tests), expanded `structured-slide-spec.test.js` (+13 tests), and `workflow-edit-structured-rebuild-e2e.test.js` (10 E2E tests) covering all 4 critical fail-closed paths (ID collision, missing Content_Types.xml, broken presentation order, neighbor drift).

### Changed
- **`update-plan.js` ACTIONS set** — added `structured_rebuild` so plans using this action type pass validation before reaching `applyAction`.
- **`structured-slide-spec.js` design token resolution** — uses `??` (nullish coalescing) instead of `||` for theme token fallback so explicitly set empty-string tokens are not silently overridden; default color tokens now uniformly include `#` prefix.
- **`structured-slide-spec.js` source_brief** — returned as a shallow copy instead of a direct reference, following project immutability rules.

## [0.1.7.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **defects-analysis Phase 5 now uses LLM-driven subagent spawn** — `phase5.sh` replaced static script-driven report generation and broken review loop with a spawn manifest pattern: pre-spawn builds `phase5_spawn_manifest.json` via `build_report_spawn_manifest.mjs`; SKILL.md orchestrator spawns the subagent; post-phase validates `context/report_review_delta.md` via `validate_report_review.mjs`.
- **new `build_report_spawn_manifest.mjs`** — reads `jira_raw.json`, `pr_impact_summary.json`, and `task.json` to emit tabular raw facts (defects + PRs) and instruct the subagent via `references/report-generation-rubric.md` and `references/report-review-rubric.md`. On round > 1, includes path to prior `context/report_review_notes.md`.
- **new `validate_report_review.mjs`** — parses `context/report_review_delta.md` verdict; `accept` clears `return_to_phase`; `return phase5` increments `phase5_round` and sets `return_to_phase: "phase5"` for orchestrator loop; exits 1 on missing/invalid delta.
- **new `references/report-generation-rubric.md`** — 12-section quality spec and data contract for the subagent report generator.
- **new `references/report-review-rubric.md`** — 12 self-review criteria (C1–C12) with pass/fail rules; subagent writes `context/report_review_notes.md` and `context/report_review_delta.md`.
- **Phase 5 review loop contract in SKILL.md** — orchestrator reads `task.json` after `--post`; loops up to 3 rounds on `return_to_phase === "phase5"`; stops with error after 3 rounds.

### Changed
- **`report_bundle_validator.mjs` now checks `context/report_review_delta.md`** — replaced `_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` + `## Review Result: pass` check with `context/report_review_delta.md` + `context/report_review_notes.md` existence and `- accept` verdict regex.
- **`phase5.sh` removes `report-quality-reviewer` dependency** — `REPORTER_SCRIPT`, `REVIEWER_SCRIPT`, `AUTO_FIX_SCRIPT` variables and the bash while loop are gone; replaced by `MANIFEST_SCRIPT` and `VALIDATE_SCRIPT` env-overridable variables.

## [0.1.6.0] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **qa-plan benchmark comparison is now executed-only** — `qa-plan-evolution` Phase 4 now requires `run_iteration_compare.mjs`, hard-fails when executed compare is missing or errors, and rejects any non-`executed` benchmark scorecard at scoring time instead of silently degrading to synthetic output.
- **qa-plan benchmark scoring now enforces real scorecard fidelity** — `scoreBenchmarkV2` rejects unsupported scoring fidelity, and the promotion path no longer carries synthetic-only acceptance branches.
- **qa-plan evolution now seeds qa-plan benchmark runtime baseline state when missing** — Phase 1 creates the canonical runtime `history.json` and `champion_snapshot` under `workspace-artifacts` so replay/compare phases can start from a valid executed benchmark baseline.

### Changed
- **qa-plan benchmark and evolution docs now describe executed-only compare semantics** — active skill and benchmark docs no longer advertise synthetic fallback behavior.
- **executed benchmark regression coverage was tightened across both skills** — updated phase4/phase5/phase6 evolution tests plus qa-plan benchmark iteration/scorer tests now assert executed compare success or hard failure only.

### Removed
- **qa-plan synthetic structural compare implementation** — removed `publishIterationComparison.mjs` and the direct synthetic-compare benchmark tests that depended on it.
- **stale defects-analysis fix-plan note** — removed the obsolete reporter-side `workspace-reporter/skills/defects-analysis/docs/fix-plan.md` document.

## [0.1.5.0] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **artifact-root runtime helpers now honor explicit repo roots through the shared contract** — shared artifact-root resolution now supports repo-root-aware run and benchmark runtime paths, and `qa-plan-evolution` resume/progress utilities continue to preserve `ARTIFACT_ROOT`, `REPO_ROOT`, and explicit run-dir overrides.
- **qa-plan-evolution now keeps qa-plan benchmark runtime state entirely under `workspace-artifacts`** — Phase 4 compare outputs, Phase 6 champion promotion, and replay-gap analysis now read source benchmark definitions from the skill tree while writing and reading live benchmark history, scorecards, and iteration snapshots from the canonical runtime root.
- **qa-plan-orchestrator benchmark/bootstrap path coverage now matches the runtime split** — benchmark runners, bootstrap argument builders, and runtime-env shell fixtures now forward benchmark definition roots explicitly and assert the `workspace-artifacts` output contract in both Node and shell regression tests.
- **artifact-root regression coverage is now complete and deterministic** — strengthened `qa-plan-evolution` and `qa-plan-orchestrator` tests now cover canonical artifact-root defaults, scratch/canonical resume behavior, runtime benchmark path updates, and deterministic fixture setup across temp workspaces.

## [0.1.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **ppt-agent: documentation quality issues** — Fixed six documentation gaps: aligned `research.md` section names with actual `speaker-script.js` output, added four new Phase 2 fields (`composition_family`, `component_list`, `primary_visual_anchor`, `render_strategy`) to `docs/README.md` update-plan schema, removed resolved Tavily strategy open question, renamed duplicate SKILL.md heading, updated stale text-only-slides caveat, and added inline "reuse-first" definition

## [0.1.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **defects-analysis: JQL query now captures all linked defects** — Replaced `text ~ "FEATURE_KEY"` with `issue in linkedIssues("X") OR parent = "X" OR "Parent Link" = "X"`, fixing missing defects (e.g. BCIN-150 case)
- **defects-analysis: False "Image Handling" classification** — Added `stripAdfArtifacts()` to remove ADF attachment filenames from description text before keyword matching; BCIN-7775 ("Discrepancy between Webstation and Workstation") no longer misclassified
- **defects-analysis: Area table inflated high-priority counts** — `groupByArea()` now only counts high-priority defects that are open; closed high-priority defects no longer inflate the "high" column

### Added
- **defects-analysis: Data-driven sections 8–10** — Section 8 now lists specific open defect keys per area; Section 9 calls `buildEnvRecommendations()` with open count and feature key; Section 10 generates per-defect `- [ ] KEY` checkboxes for all open high-priority and blocking defects
- **defects-analysis: Test suite for `derive_functional_area.mjs`** — New `derive_functional_area.test.js` with 18 cases covering ADF artifact stripping, keyword classification, explicit area precedence, and all AREA_RULES
- **defects-analysis: New tests for `generate_feature_report.mjs` and `phase2.sh`** — 5 additional test cases covering `groupByArea` high-count gating, section 8 key emission, section 9 open count, section 10 checkboxes, and JQL linkedIssues clause

### Added

- Added a descendant-activity pruning regression test for `qa-plan-evolution` so active runs are retained even when only nested artifacts change.
- Added split `ppt-agent` enrichment-plan draft docs for the reviewed Part 1 / Part 2 design.

### Changed

- Changed `qa-plan-evolution` run pruning to rank runs by the newest descendant artifact activity instead of top-level run directory mtime only.
- Changed `defects-analysis` manifest execution to fall back from `openclaw` to `codex` when local spawn runtime support is unavailable, with end-to-end scoped-release regression coverage.
- Expanded the skill-artifact-root extraction design and TODO backlog with the newly identified follow-up work.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- Added scoped release run support in `defects-analysis` with `qa_owner` filters, scope-aware run keys, and release scope query metadata artifacts.
- Added pruning support for `qa-plan-evolution` run directories with dedicated script and test coverage.
- Added benchmark skill-path contract utilities and test coverage in `qa-plan-orchestrator`.

### Changed

- Expanded `defects-analysis` release/feature report generation and classification/test contracts, including stronger CLI/input validation behavior.
- Updated `qa-plan-orchestrator` benchmark prompts, execution selection, and grading harness behavior with aligned tests.
- Updated `ppt-agent` docs and references, and moved legacy design artifacts to archive paths.

### Removed

- Removed outdated top-level PPT agent design/review markdown/json artifacts from `docs/` now superseded by archived and in-skill sources.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- Established canonical root release metadata files for repository shipping and release tracking.

### Changed

- Standardized repository release metadata ownership in the root so automated shipping and review workflows use one canonical convention.
